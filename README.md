# DP_Spark
DP_Spark
makes use of spark dataframes to process the csv files.
The csv files used here contain the weather data of two different cities. The parameters windSpeed and maxTemp are used to classify whether the day is good, bad or average.
We have implemented three user defined functions for classifying the days. The final output has 3 derived columns showing the classification.
