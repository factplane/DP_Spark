DP_Spark
This program makes use of spark dataframe to process the csv files.
The csv files used here contain the weather data of two different cities. The parameter windSpeed and maxTemp are used to classify whether the day is good, bad or average.
We have implemented three user defined functions for classifying the days. The final output has 3 synthetic columns showing the classification.
